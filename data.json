CRDC 2004 (https://ocrdata.ed.gov/) is a cross-sectional survey that collects data on key education and civil rights issues in the nation's public school, including student enrollment and educational programs and services, disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency, and disability. The study was conducted using surveys of LEAs and the schools in the LEAs. LEAs and BOCES-type regional education centers functioning as LEAs were sampled. Prior to 2011-12, charter schools were primarily sampled if they were part of a LEA, not if they were a separate charter school district. For CRDC 2004, the response rates, including partial respondents to the data collection, were approximately 97% of all LEAs (95% of all LEAs responded completely with clean data-which is consistent with the 2002 Elementary and Secondary Survey), and 97% of all schools (94% of all schools responded completely with clean data). Key statistics produced from CRDC 2004 can provide information about critical civil rights issues as well as contextual information on the state of civil rights in the nation, including enrollment demographics, advanced placement, discipline, and special education services.",

The study was conducted using multiple data collection methods (computer-assisted in-person interviews, computer-assisted telephone interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and direct observation) to collect information about children's characteristics, behaviors, development, and experiences from the adults who were important in the children's lives, including mothers, fathers, early care and education providers, and teachers. Direct child assessments were used to measure children's development, knowledge, and skills from the time the children were about 9 months old. A nationally representative sample of approximately 14,000 children born in the U.S. in 2001 was fielded. Key statistics produced from ECLS-B focus on children's health, development, care, and education during the formative years from birth through kindergarten entry.",

EDFacts GD:2017–18 (ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts) annually collects cross-sectional data from states about student who graduate or receive a certificate of completion from secondary education or students who dropped out of secondary education at the school, LEA, and state levels. EDFacts GD:2017–18 data were collected using the EDFacts Submission System (ESS), a centralized portal and their submission by states is mandatory and required for benefits. Not submitting the required reports by a state constitutes a failure to comply with law and may have consequences for federal funding to the state. Key statistics produced from EDFacts GD:2017–18 are from 6 data groups with information on Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate (Four, Five, and Six Year)-Graduation Rate; Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate (Four, Five, and Six Year)-Student Counts; Graduation Rate; Graduates/Completers; Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate-Flex; and Regulatory Cohort Graduation Rate Student Counts-Flex. For the purposes of this system, data groups are referred to as variables, as a result of the structure and format of EDFacts' data.",

EDFacts T3/LEP:2010-11 (ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts) annually collects cross-sectional data from states to support oversight and reporting of programs for the education of limited English proficient students as contained in Title I and Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended. Title III also provides programs for students who are immigrants at the SEA and LEA levels. EDFacts T3/LEP:2010-11 data were collected using the EDFacts Submission System (ESS), a centralized portal and their submission by states is mandatory and required for benefits. Not submitting the required reports by a state constitutes a failure to comply with law and may have consequences for federal funding to the state. Key statistics produced from EDFacts T3/LEP:2010-11 are from 13 data groups: AMAO I LEP Making Progress, AMAO II LEP English Attainment, AMAO III AYP for LEP, Immigrant, LEP Enrolled, LEP Students in LEP Program, LEP English Language Proficiency Results, LEP English Language Proficiency Test, Title III Teachers, Title III LEP English Language Proficiency Results, Title III LEP English Language Proficiency Test, Title III LEP Students Served, and Title III Former LEP Students. For the purposes of this system, data groups are referred to as 'variables', as a result of the structure and format of EDFacts' data.",

Each area is divided into three subtypes based on population size (in the case of City and Suburban assignments) and proximity to urban areas (in the case of Town and Rural assignments). The classifications PDF File (318 KB) rely on standard urban and rural designations defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, and each type of locale is either urban or rural in its entirety. The NCES locales can be fully collapsed into a basic urban/rural dichotomy, or expanded into a more detailed collection of twelve distinct categories. NCES provides a locale assignment for each institution in its administrative data collections (Common Core of Data (CCD), Integrated Post-secondary Education Data Set (IPEDS), and the Private School Survey (PSS)), and locale assignments are included as an indicator in most NCES school-based sample surveys.",

      "description": "Prior to 2016, the U.S. Department of Education previously relied on legacy geographic classification framework to support the needs of the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP), an initiative that targets resources and provides additional administrative flexibility for small school systems that serve rural areas. REAP adopted the NCES locale framework when the program was reauthorized in 2015, but the EDGE program retains the REAP locale boundary layer as a resource for research. The REAP locale framework classified all territory in the U.S. into four types of areas -- City, Urban Fringe, Town, and Rural. Each area is divided into two subtypes based on population size (in the case of City, Urban Fringe, and Town assignments) and proximity to metropolitan areas (in the case of Rural assignments).  ",

The program relies on school and district-level urban and rural assignments to determine the discount level. Urban assignments are based on territory that includes all Census-defined Urbanized Areas and all Urban Clusters with a population of 25,000 or more. Rural assignments are based on territory that includes all Census-defined rural territory, as well as Urban Clusters with a population less than 25,000. Although the U.S. Department of Education does not operate the E-Rate program, it serves many of the same schools and school districts that participate in E-Rate, so the E-Rate locales are included here to facilitate research. Additional information about the E-Rate program is available at www.usac.org/sl.",

Data is available since 2003 at <https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/>. The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act requires co-educational institutions of postsecondary education that participate in a Title IV, federal student financial assistance program, and have an intercollegiate athletic program, to prepare an annual report to the Department of Education on athletic participation, staffing, and revenues and expenses, by men's and women's teams. This cross-sectional data collection was administered via an online survey. In 2013, the collection's response rate was 100 percent. Key statistics from EADA 2013 were designed to make prospective students aware of a schools� commitment to providing equitable athletic opportunities for its men and women students; as well, results were used in the Department's report to Congress on gender equity in intercollegiate athletics.",

FRSS 84 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/) is a cross-sectional survey that provides national estimates on distance education courses in public school districts, including enrollment in distance education courses, how districts monitor these courses, the motivations for providing distance education, and the technologies used for delivering distance education. Superintendents of sampled public school districts received a paper questionnaire in the mail and were instructed that the staff member most knowledgeable about the district�s distance education practices should complete it. The study's weighted response rate was 96 percent. Key statistics produced from FRSS 84 are information on the prevalence of technology-based distance education courses, enrollments of public elementary and secondary school students in distance education courses, the types of technologies most commonly used for delivering distance education courses, districts' reasons for having distance education courses, and factors districts report that prevent their expansion of distance education course offerings.",

Key statistics produced from the study were the percent of districts and the percent of schools (by instructional level) with students enrolled in technology-based distance education courses. The number of enrollments in distance education courses (by instructional level) was also collected. The survey contained questions on the completion status of the enrollments in distance education. Districts were asked to report the technologies used to deliver distance education courses and where students accessed online distance education courses (e.g., at school or at home). The survey included questions on whether technology-based distance education was used to offer Advanced Placement (AP) and college-level courses to students. Districts with students enrolled in technology-based distance education courses were asked whether they planned to expand their distance education courses.",

FRSS 91 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/) is a sample survey that provides a national profile of various types of formal after-school programs physically located at public elementary schools in 2008. These programs include stand-alone programs that focus primarily on a single type of service (e.g., only day care) and broad-based programs that provide a combination of services such as academic enrichment and cultural activities. The study was conducted using surveys via web or by mail. Principals of public elementary schools were sampled. The study's weighted response rate was 91 percent. Key statistics produced from FRSS 91 were program focus (if applicable), number of students enrolled, hours per week the program operates, availability of transportation for students, whether students from other schools attend the program, and factors that may hinder students from participating in the program.",

FRSS 92 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/) is a sample survey that provides national estimates on the availability and use of educational technology in public elementary and secondary schools during fall 2008. This is one of a set of three surveys (at the district, school, and teacher levels) that collected data on a range of educational technology resources. The study was conducted using mailed questionnaires and respondents had the option of completing the survey via the web. Schools were sampled. The study's weighted response rate was 79 percent. Key statistics produced from FRSS 92 were information on computer hardware and internet access, availability of staff to help integrate technology into instruction and provide timely technical support, and perceptions of educational technology issues at the school and district levels. Respondents reported the number of instructional computers within their schools, by type, mobility, and location. The survey also asked respondents about the types of operating systems or platforms used on instructional computers. Data on the number of handheld devices provided to school personnel and students, and the number of other technology devices provided for instructional purposes were also collected. Respondents indicated the extent to which technology staff provided assistance with technology support and integration and the response times for obtaining such support. Respondents gave opinions on statements related to using educational technology in their schools.",

FAFSA 2011-12 (https://studentaid.ed.gov/) is a universe data collection of eligible incoming postsecondary education students, along with a subset of eligible continuing postsecondary education students, that collects financial information to determine the need and eligibility for financial assistance during postsecondary education.

Citizen and specified noncitizen students demonstrating financial need and planning to attend eligible degree or certificate programs in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the outlying areas as regular students are eligible to apply for FAFSA 2011-12. FAFSA 2011-12 resulted in an expected family contribution (EFC) for each applying student. Statistics produced from FAFSA 2011-12 include application volumes by postsecondary school, state of legal residence, and completion by high school; and recipient and volume data by program for each school participating in Title IV programs.",

FAFSA 2015-16 (https://studentaid.ed.gov/) is a universe data collection of eligible incoming postsecondary education students, along with a subset of eligible continuing postsecondary education students, that collects financial information to determine the need and eligibility for financial assistance during postsecondary education. FAFSA 2015-16 applications are accepted via web and paper submission. Citizen and specified noncitizen students demonstrating financial need and planning to attend eligible degree or certificate programs in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the outlying areas as regular students are eligible to apply for FAFSA 2015-16. FAFSA 2015-16 resulted in an expected family contribution (EFC) for each applying student. Statistics produced from FAFSA 2015-16 include application volumes by postsecondary school, state of legal residence, and completion by high school; and recipient and volume data by program for each school participating in Title IV programs.",

RTT-SIG Impact Evaluation (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/evaluation/other_racetotop.asp) is a cross-sectional survey that assesses the implementation of the Race to the Top (RTT) and School Improvement Grant (SIG) programs at the State, local education agency (LEA), and school levels, as well as whether the receipt of RTT and/or SIG funding to implement a school turnaround model has had an impact on outcomes for the lowest-achieving schools. Additionally, the study investigates whether RTT reforms were related to improvements in student outcomes and whether implementation of the four school turnaround models, and the strategies within those models, was related to improvement in outcomes for the lowest-achieving schools. The study was conducted using a combination of telephone interviews and web-based surveys targeted to school administrators at the state, LEA, and school levels. Key statistics produced from RTT-SIG Impact Evaluation include State, LEA, and school adoption levels of policies and practices promoted by RTT and SIG, as well as impacts on student outcomes of RTT and SIG funding.",

All Title IV institutions were required to respond to IPEDS (see Section 490 of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 [P.L. 102-325; 20 U.S.C. � 1070 et seq.]). IPEDS allowed other, non-Title IV institutions to participate on a voluntary basis, but only about 200 elected to respond.",

It is a longitudinal survey that monitors the transitions of a national sample of young people as they progress from tenth grade to, eventually, the world of work. In 2004, the sample was augmented to make it representative of seniors as well. The study was conducted using self-administered questionnaires and cognitive tests of students, parents, teachers, librarians, and school administrators. Students and their high school administrators, library media coordinators, mathematics and English teachers, and parents in the spring term of the 2002 school year were sampled. The study�s base year weighted response rate was 87.3 percent for students, 98.5 percent for school administrators, 95.9 percent for library media coordinators, 91.6 percent for both mathematics and English teachers, 87.5 percent for parents, and 67.8 percent for schools. Key statistics produced from ELS:2002 focus on the changes taking place in the lives of students which can be understood by life achievements, aspirations, and experiences.",

NELS:88 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/) is a longitudinal study that is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave middle or junior high school, and progress through high school and into postsecondary institutions or the work force. A nationally representative sample of eighth-graders were first surveyed in the spring of 1988. A sample of these respondents were then resurveyed through four follow-ups in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000. Overall weighted response rate was unavailable as of December 2014. Key statistics produced from NELS:88 data can be used for policy-relevant research about educational processes and outcomes, for example: student learning; early and late predictors of dropping out; and school effects on students' access to programs and equal opportunity to learn.",

HSTS 2005 (https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/) is a cross-sectional survey that periodically surveys the curricula being followed in our nation's high schools and the coursetaking patterns of high school students through a collection of transcripts. For public schools, the HSTS sample included every eligible sampled NAEP 2005 twelfth-grade public school that was contacted for the HSTS, whether or not they actually participated in the NAEP assessments. For private schools, the HSTS sample was a subsample from the NAEP 2005 twelfth-grade private school sample for the mathematics and science assessments. The study was conducted using a survey of school administrative personnel and collection of students' transcripts. Schools participating in the 12th-grade NAEP math and science assessments in 2005 were sampled. The study�s weighted response rate was 84.2 percent. HSTS 2005 also offers information on the relationship of student coursetaking patterns to achievement at grade 12 as measured by NAEP. Key statistics produced from HSTS 2005 are information about the types of courses that graduates took, how many credits they earned, their grade point averages, and the relationship between coursetaking patterns and achievement, as measured by NAEP.",

HSTS 2009 (https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/) is a cross-sectional survey that periodically surveys the curricula being followed in our nation's high schools and the coursetaking patterns of high school students through a collection of transcripts. The study was conducted using survey of school administrative personnel and collection of students' transcripts. For public schools, the HSTS sample was a subsample of the NAEP 2009 twelfth-grade public school sample for the operational mathematics and science assessments. For private schools, the HSTS sample was the NAEP 2009 twelfth-grade private school sample for the operational mathematics and science assessments. The study�s weighted response rate was 83 percent. HSTS 2009 also offers information on the relationship of student coursetaking patterns to achievement at grade 12 as measured by NAEP. Key statistics produced from HSTS 2009 are information about the types of courses that graduates take, how many credits they earn, their grade point averages, and the relationship between coursetaking patterns and achievement, as measured by NAEP.",

NAEP 2014 (https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/) is a cross-sectional survey that assesses what America's students know and can do in various subject areas. The study is conducted using computer-based assessment of students. Students in grade 4, 8, and 12 are sampled. NAEP 2014 assessments consist of national assessments in civics, geography, U.S. history, and technology and engineering literacy for 8th-grade students. Key statistics produced from NAEP 2014 are results on subject-matter achievement, instructional experiences, and school environment for populations of students (e.g., all fourth-graders) and groups within those populations (e.g. female students, Hispanic students).",

NLTS2 (https://ies.ed.gov/ncser/projects/nlts2) is a longitudinal survey that was designed to provide a national picture of the experiences and achievements of students in special education during high school and as they transition from high school to adult life. NLTS2 involved five waves of data collection using three main data collection components: (1) telephone interviews with parents and youth who are capable of completing a phone interview; (2) direct assessments and in-person interviews with youth while they are in secondary school; and (3) the collection of school data (e.g., surveys of teachers, special education teachers, principals). A nationally representative sample of students who were 13 to 16 years old and receiving special education services in December 2000 when the study began were sampled, and these students were followed until 2010. Key statistics produced from NLTS2 are characteristics of secondary school students in special education and their households; secondary school experiences of students in special education, including their schools, school programs, related services, and extracurricular activities; experiences of students once they leave secondary school, including adult programs and services, social activities, etc.; and measurement of the secondary school and postschool outcomes of students in the education, employment, social, and residential domains.",

NPSAS:93 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas/about.asp) is a cross-sectional survey that is designed to compile a comprehensive research dataset, based on student-level records, on financial aid provided by the federal government, the states, postsecondary institutions, employers, and private agencies along with student demographic and enrollment data. The study was conducted using multiple sources, including institutional records, government databases, and student interviews. NPSAS:93 contains the data on a sample of about 66,000 eligible postsecondary students who were enrolled at any time between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993 in about 1,100 postsecondary institutions. The data are representative of all undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico that were eligible to participate in the federal financial aid programs in Title IV of the Higher Education Act. After adjusting for institutional nonresponse and for attendance at more than one institution, the overall weighted study response rate was 85 percent. Statistics produced from the NPSAS:93 provide reliable national estimates of characteristics related to financial aid for postsecondary students.",

NSOPF:04 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nsopf/) is a cross-sectional survey that provides a national profile of postsecondary faculty and instructional staff: their professional backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, and attitudes. The study was conducted using self-administered web-based questionnaires and a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) of postsecondary faculty and instructional staff. Postsecondary faculty and instructional staff in the academic term of Fall 2003 were sampled. The study�s weighted response rate was 76 percent for postsecondary faculty and 84 percent for institutions. Key statistics produced from NSOPF:04 are counts of faculty, faculty hires and departures, tenure of faculty, tenure policies, retirement and other benefits of faculty, faculty characteristics, employment history, current employment status including rank and tenure, workload, courses taught, publications, job satisfaction and attitudes, career and retirement plans, and benefits and compensation.",

PEQIS 14 (https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009045) is a cross-sectional survey that collected information on the topic of dual enrollment of high school students at postsecondary institutions. 1,600 Title IV degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia were sampled. The study was conducted using online or paper surveys. The overall response rates were 92 percent weighted and 91 percent unweighted. Key statistics produced from PEQIS 14 were information on the prevalence of college course-taking by high school students at their institutions during the 2002-03 12-month academic year, both within and outside of dual enrollment programs. Among institutions with dual enrollment programs, additional information was obtained on the characteristics of programs, including course location and type of instructors, program and course curriculum, academic eligibility requirements, and funding.",

PEQIS 15 (https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2008040) is a cross-sectional survey that collected information about teacher education programs for initial licensure of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade (PK-12) teachers. Title IV four-year degree-granting postsecondary institutions located in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia were sampled. The study was conducted using questionnaires for all eligible four-year institutions in the United States as identified from the 2004 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) \"Institutional Characteristics\" survey (IPEDS-IC). The study's response rate was 95 percent. Key statistics produced from PEQIS 15 include information on the educational technology-related topics and practices taught within teacher education programs for initial licensure, the extent to which teacher candidates are taught to use technology tools for a variety of purposes, the extent to which teacher candidates are able to practice what they learn during their field experiences (and the extent to which this opportunity is impeded by a variety of barriers within classrooms), and the perceived program outcomes for graduates of programs for initial licensure.",

PSS 1989–90 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/) is a cross-sectional survey that collects data on private elementary and secondary schools, including religious orientation, level of school, length of school year, length of school day, total enrollment (K–12), race/ethnicity of students, number of high school graduates, number of teachers employed, program emphasis, and existence and type of kindergarten program. The study was conducted using mail questionnaires and telephone follow-up of all private schools in the United States.

PSS 2005-06 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/) is a cross-sectional survey that collects data on private elementary and secondary schools, including religious orientation, level of school, length of school year, length of school day, total enrollment (K-12), race/ethnicity of students, number of high school graduates, number of teachers employed, program emphasis, and existence and type of kindergarten program. The study was conducted using mail questionnaires and telephone follow-up of all private schools in the United States. The PSS universe consists of a diverse population of schools. It includes both schools with a religious orientation (e.g., Catholic, Lutheran, or Jewish) and nonsectarian schools with programs ranging from regular to special emphasis and special education. The study�s unweighted and weighted response rates were both 94 percent. Key statistics produced from PSS 2005-06 are on the growth of religiously affiliated schools, the number of private high school graduates, the length of the school year for various private schools, and the number of private school students and teachers.",

The study is conducted using mail questionnaires, an internet response option and telephone and personal follow-up of all private schools in the United States. The PSS universe consists of a diverse population of schools. It includes both schools with a religious orientation (e.g., Catholic, Lutheran, or Jewish) and nonsectarian schools with programs ranging from regular to special emphasis and special education. Keys statistics produced from PSS 2013-14 are on the number of private schools, students, and teachers, the number of high school graduates, the length of the school year and school day.",

Two-hundred such volunteer teachers from six local education agencies (LEAs) were recruited to be randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. Teachers in the experimental group were given the PD intervention, whereas teachers in the control group engaged in their LEAs' and schools' standard PD regimen over the 2013-14 academic year. At the end of the experimental period, a survey was then administered to obtain teacher background information for covariate use in the impact analyses. Key statistics produced from Elementary School Math PD Evaluation include, inter alia, the implementation of the PD program and its impact on the participating teachers' students' achievement in the classroom.",

PIAAC Prison:14 (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/national_supp.asp) is part of the National Supplement and draws from a sample of 1,200 inmates aged 18 to 74 years-old currently detained in State, Federal, or private prisons in the United States. The direct assessments of literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving in technology-rich environments are the same for the adults in prison. The background questionnaire was tailored specifically to address the experiences and needs of this subgroup. For example, the background questionnaire asks about activities in prison, such as participation in academic programs and ESL classes, experiences with prison jobs, and involvement in non-academic programs such as employment readiness classes.",

SASS 87-88 is a system of surveys that cover a wide range of topics from teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, general conditions in schools, principals’ and teachers’ perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher compensation, district hiring and retention policies, to basic characteristics of the student population. The surveys were conducted using mail, paper questionnaires, and telephone interviews. Teachers, principals, school district coordinators and school coordinators were sampled. Key statistics produced from SASS 87-88 are average teacher salaries and the percentage of teachers by teaching field. Key statistics from the follow-up to SASS 87-88 (TFS 88-89) are the percentage of teachers staying at the same school, moving to a new school, or leaving the teaching profession. Prior to the founding of SASS in 1987-88, there were three sets of Elementary and Secondary School Division surveys administered by the National Center for Education Statistics in different years: the “Teacher Demand and Shortage Surveys,” the “Public and Private School Surveys,” and the “Teacher Surveys.” The public and private sector versions of each of these three survey types were conducted in alternate years.",

This 2001 Sexual Harassment Guidance reaffirms the compliance standards that OCR applies in investigations and administrative enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 regarding sexual harassment. The guidance provides the principles that a school should use to recognize and effectively respond to sexual harassment of students in its program as a condition of receiving Federal financial assistance. This 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence explains that the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 cover sexual violence and reminds schools of their responsibilities to take immediate and effective steps to respond to sexual violence in accordance with the requirements of Title IX. This 2013 Dear Colleague Letter on Retaliation reminds school districts, postsecondary institutions, and other recipients that retaliation is also a violation of Federal law. The letter seeks to clarify the basic principles of retaliation law and to describe OCR�s methods of enforcement.",

      "description": "The Promise Neighborhoods Fund website depicts open grantmaking information on the applicants received, grantees awarded and project locations. The purpose of Promise Neighborhoods is to improve significantly the educational and developmental outcomes of children in our most distressed communities, and to transform those communities by-- (1) Supporting efforts to improve child outcomes and ensure that data on those outcomes are communicated and analyzed on an ongoing basis by leaders and members of the community; (2) Identifying and increasing the capacity of eligible entities that are focused on achieving results and building a college-going culture in the neighborhood; (3) Building a complete continuum of cradle-through-college-to-career solutions (continuum of solutions), which has both academic programs and family and community supports, with a strong school or schools at the center. Academic programs must include (a) High-quality early learning programs designed to improve outcomes in multiple domains of early learning; (b) programs, policies, and personnel for children in kindergarten through the 12th grade that are linked to improved academic outcomes; and (c) programs that prepare students for college and career success. Family and community supports must include programs to improve student health, safety, community stability, family and community engagement, and student access to 21st century learning tools. The continuum of solutions also must be linked and integrated seamlessly so there are common outcomes, a focus on similar milestones, support during transitional time periods, and no time or resource gaps that create obstacles for students in making academic progress. The continuum also must be based on the best available evidence including, where available, strong or moderate evidence, and include programs, policies, practices, services, systems, and supports that result in improving educational and developmental outcomes for children from cradle through college to career; (4) Integrating programs and breaking down agency \"silos\" so that solutions are implemented effectively and efficiently across agencies; (5) Supporting the efforts of eligible entities, working with local governments, to build the infrastructure of policies, practices, systems, and resources needed to sustain and \"scale up\" proven, effective solutions across the broader region beyond the initial neighborhood; and (6) Learning about the overall impact of Promise Neighborhoods and about the relationship between particular strategies in Promise Neighborhoods and student outcomes, including a rigorous evaluation of the program.",

They also provide financial breakdowns of expenditures by vocational rehabilitation agencies as well as information on referrals sources, services provided to individuals, counselor caseloads and eligibility rates. Tables cover consumer information and information on VR agency expenditures. While several programs exist to assist individuals with disabilities to become employed, the primary one overseen by the Department of Education is the vocational rehabilitation (VR) program. Under Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Act), states receive federal grants to operate a comprehensive VR program. These funds are awarded to designated state VR agencies within each state. This state-operated program is designed to assess, plan, develop and provide VR services to eligible individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests and informed choice. By providing services in this way, the VR program enables individuals with disabilities to prepare for and engage in employment.  For data after 2005, see rsa.ed.gov.",

States were awarded nearly $3.5 billion in School Improvement Grant funds in 2010 to turn around their persistently lowest achieving schools. School districts then applied to state for the funds this spring. When school districts applied, they were required to indicate that they would implement one of the following four models in their persistently lowest achieving schools: Turnaround Model: Replace the principal, screen existing school staff, and rehire no more than half the teachers; adopt a new governance structure; and improve the school through curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and other strategies. Restart Model: Convert a school or close it and re-open it as a charter school or under an education management organization. School Closure: Close the school and send the students to higher-achieving schools in the district. Transformation Model: Replace the principal and improve the school through comprehensive curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and other strategies.",

      "description": "Thank you for your interest in the Ready to Learn Television program! Ready to Learn Television supports the development of educational television and digital media targeted at preschool and early elementary school children and their families. Its general goal is to promote early learning and school readiness, with a particular interest in reaching low-income children. In addition to creating television and other media products, the program supports activities intended to promote national distribution of the programming, effective educational uses of the programming, community-based outreach, and research on educational effectiveness. You can use the tools below to look at general information about the grant applications that were submitted in June 2010. There were a total of 38 eligible applications, of which three were selected for funding. In this 2010 competition, applicants were invited to submit proposals for the development of innovative transmedia programming - that is, the use of television and other media such as the internet, mobile devices, and print in interconnected ways. In the 2010 grant competition, there was a two-tier review process in which the applications that scored the highest against the program's general review criteria were advanced to a second tier in which their responses to the competitive preference priority on research were scored. In the data summaries below, applicants that advanced to tier two are denoted as \"highly rated applicants,\" and those that received awards are listed as \"grantees\". The data presented here is sourced from the applications submitted to the program. The data may not be a full representation of the information provided in the formal application. Inclusion of an application in this summary information is not an endorsement of an organization, idea, program, or product, and the Department does not validate or guarantee the accuracy of this information. The data are provided in this summary solely for the convenience of the public. For more information about the Ready to Learn program, go to https://www2.ed.gov/programs/rtltv/index.html.",

      "description": "The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act is a federal statute requiring colleges and universities participating in federal financial aid programs to maintain and disclose campus crime statistics and security information. The U.S. Department of Education conducts reviews to evaluate an institution's compliance with the Clery Act requirements. A review may be initiated when a complaint is received, a media event raises certain concerns, the school's independent audit identifies serious noncompliance, or through a review selection process that may also coincide with state reviews performed by the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Service (CJIS) Audit Unit. Once a review is completed, the Department issues a Final Program Review Determination. Although regular program reviews may contain Clery Act findings, this page includes only those program reviews that were focused exclusively on the Clery Act.",

It launched a comprehensive Digital Government Strategy (pdf/html5) aimed at delivering better digital services to the American people. The strategy builds on several initiatives, including Executive Order 13571, Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service, and Executive Order 13576, Delivering an Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Government. The strategy lays out actions in a 12-month roadmap and has three main objectives: (1) Enable the American people and an increasingly mobile workforce to access high-quality digital government information and services anywhere, anytime, on any device. (2) Ensure that as the government adjusts to this new digital world, we seize the opportunity to procure and manage devices, applications, and data in smart, secure and affordable ways. (3) Unlock the power of government data to spur innovation across our Nation and improve the quality of services for the American people.",

NTPS <https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps/> will replace SASS as one of the key sources of nationally representative data on a range of important education topics including out-of-field teaching, school decision making, professional development, teacher and principal evaluation, and career paths of educators and administrators. The repeated cross-sectional design of NTPS allows tracking of trends on these topics over time. The survey is conducted through a combination of online and paper questionnaires. The sample includes teachers, principals, and schools, and is nationally representative.",

TSFG <https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/evaluation/tq_teacherprep_early.asp> includes a cross-sectional survey that measures the frequency of particular variations in teachers' preparation experiences. The study examines whether the instructional skills that teachers learn about and have opportunities to practice in their preparation programs are associated with novice teachers' effectiveness in the classroom, as measured by teacher value-added scores. The data collection was conducted using electronic data collection from school districts and online surveys of school districts and elementary and middle school teachers. Teachers in their first, second, or third year of teaching responsible for teaching to at least one general education classroom of fourth- through sixth-grade students were sampled. TSFG will compute value-added scores for teachers, based on students' state math and English language arts tests, and examine the relationships between teacher preparation experiences and teacher value-added scores.",

PFS 16/17 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps/overview.asp?OverviewType=6) is a longitudinal follow-up to the National Teacher and Principal Survey, 2015–16 (NTPS 2015–16) data collection. PFS 16/17 determined mobility patterns of principals in the base (NTPS 2015–16) school year. The PFS 16/17 sample includes all schools whose principals completed questionnaires in NTPS 2015–16. Schools and principals were mailed the PFS questionnaire. Nonrespondents were followed-up via telephone. Key statistics produced from PFS 16/17 include the number of principals that still worked as a principal in the same school in the following school year, how many moved to become a principal in another school, how many left the principalship altogether, and from those who left the principalship, what percentage retired or sought work in another occupational field.",

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. The CCD program also provides fiscal data about school district revenues and expenditures. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools reported in the annual CCD directory file.

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. The CCD program also provides fiscal data about school district revenues and expenditures. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for local education agency (LEA) administrative offices reported in the annual CCD directory file. The point locations in this data layer represent the most current CCD collection available. Check the SURVYEAR attribute in the data table to determine file vintage.

School districts are single-purpose administrative units designed by state and local officials to organize and provide public education for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to support educational research and program administration, and the boundaries are essential for constructing district-level estimates of the number of children in poverty. </span></span></p><p><span><span>The Census Bureau’s School District Boundary Review program (SDBR) (</span></span><a href='https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html' rel='nofollow ugc'><span><span>https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html</span></span></a><span>) obtains the boundaries, names, and grade ranges from state officials, and integrates these updates into Census TIGER. Census TIGER boundaries include legal maritime buffers for coastal areas by default, but the NCES composite file removes these buffers to facilitate broader use and cleaner cartographic representation. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop the composite school district files.

      "description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><p style='margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;'>This data layer produced by the National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program provides a geographic locale framework that classifies all U.S. territory into twelve categories ranging from Large Cities to Remote Rural areas. NCES uses this framework to describe the type of geographic area where schools and school districts are located. The criteria for these classifications are defined by NCES, but they rely on standard geographic areas developed and maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2019 NCES Locale boundaries are based on geographic areas represented in Census TIGER/Line 2019. The NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to annually update the locale boundaries.

The PSS is conducted to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, teachers, and students, and to build an accurate and complete list of private schools to serve as a sampling frame for NCES surveys. The PSS school location and associated geographic area assignments are derived from reported information about the physical location of private schools. The school geocode file includes supplemental geographic information for the universe of schools reported in the most current PSS school sample, and they can be integrated with the survey files through use of institutional identifiers included in both sources. </span><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Check the SCHOOLYEAR attribute in the data table to determine file vintage. </span><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>For more information about NCES school point data, see: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/SchoolLocations' rel='nofollow ugc' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/SchoolLocations</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'> and </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/LocaleBoundaries' rel='nofollow ugc' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/LocaleBoundaries</a><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>.</span></p><p><span style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Previous collections are available for the following year:</span></p><p></p><ul><li><a href='https://nces.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=528953aa81b24f6f8ec071302c550401' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>2015-16</a><br /></li></ul><p></p></div>",

      "description": "The National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated point locations (latitude and longitude) for postsecondary institutions included in the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The IPEDS program annually collects information about enrollments, program completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid from every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended). IPEDS school point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau's Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for schools reported in the annual IPEDS file. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2018-2019 IPEDS collection.

The PSS is conducted to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, teachers, and students, and to build an accurate and complete list of private schools to serve as a sampling frame for NCES surveys. The PSS school location and associated geographic area assignments are derived from reported information about the physical location of private schools. The school geocode file includes supplemental geographic information for the universe of schools reported in the 2017-2018 PSS school sample, and they can be integrated with the survey files through use of institutional identifiers included in both sources.

The PSS is conducted to generate biennial data on the total number of private schools, teachers, and students, and to build an accurate and complete list of private schools to serve as a sampling frame for NCES surveys. The PSS school location and associated geographic area assignments are derived from reported information about the physical location of private schools. The school geocode file includes supplemental geographic information for the universe of schools reported in the 2015-2016 PSS school sample, and they can be integrated with the survey files through use of institutional identifiers included in both sources.

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. The CCD program also provides fiscal data about school district revenues and expenditures. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for local education agency (LEA) administrative offices reported in the annual CCD directory file. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2018-2019 CCD collection.

      "description": "<p>The National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimate (EDGE) program develops annually updated school district boundary composite files that include public elementary, secondary, and unified school district boundaries clipped to the U.S. shoreline. School districts are single-purpose administrative units designed by state and local officials to organize and provide public education for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to support educational research and program administration, and the boundaries are essential for constructing district-level estimates of the number of children in poverty.</p><p>The Census Bureau’s School District Boundary Review program (SDBR) (<a href='https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html' rel='nofollow ugc'>https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sdrp.html</a>) obtains the boundaries, names, and grade ranges from state officials, and integrates these updates into Census TIGER. Census TIGER boundaries include legal maritime buffers for coastal areas by default, but the NCES composite file removes these buffers to facilitate broader use and cleaner cartographic representation. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau’s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop the composite school district files.

Attendance boundaries, sometimes known as school catchment areas, define the geographic extent served by a local school for the purpose of student assignments. School district administrators create attendance areas to help organize and plan district-wide services, and districts may adjust individual school boundaries to help balance the physical capacity of local schools with changes in the local school-age population. The SABS collection includes boundaries for more than 70,000 schools in over 12,000 school districts throughout the U.S.</span></span></p><p></div></div></div></p>",
